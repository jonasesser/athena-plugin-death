Migrated core-death plugin from athena v4 to v5.
Death already in core v5, but you can use this plugin as basis for your own death mechanism.
The default V5 Death will be automatically deactivated by using this plugin!

#Installation
The plugin name is still "core-death". Renaming maybe needed after clone!
